# PatientPortal
 
# I developed a patient portal where the patients can make appointments with a certain doctor. Also, you can see all the doctors, the patients, and the hospitals from the database.
# In this project, I practice pair programming, and we used Spring MVC, MySQL, and Thymeleaf on the front-end.
